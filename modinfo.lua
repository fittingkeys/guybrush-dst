description = [[
🏴‍☠️ A Monkey Island tribute mod for Don't Starve Together!

Join Guybrush on his drunken journey through the Constant – featuring custom items, cursed mechanics, and questionable decisions.

✔ Play as Guybrush or his altered Gulet form  
✔ New "Drunkenness" mechanic with visible HUD  
✔ Grog-fueled abilities and side effects  
✔ Unique pirate-themed gear, vending machines & currency  
✔ Lots of grog. Probably too much grog.

Baked with love. Drowned in Grog. Thanks, Grandma.
