‚úÖ Feature List

1) Drunk Beefalo ("Grogalo")
Introducing a new Beefalo type as one of five possible taming outcomes. The Grogalo is tamed exclusively by repeatedly feeding it Grog. 
Once tamed, it runs significantly faster than normal Beefalos for 5 minutes after each Grog dose.
If no Grog is provided before the effect wears off, the Grogalo throws off the rider.
It visually appears drunk: confused eyes, untidy hair, slimy grog on his nose.

2) Guyhat Water Speed Bonus
The Guyhat should increase movement speed on water, similar to the Sleek Hat.
(Maybe someone has an easier to implement idea for the hat?)

3) Treasure Hunting
The Bone X marker on the ground should drop a item that can be used for additional crafting recipes.

4) Drinking Incentive Mechanic for Guybrush
Add gameplay benefits or humorous mechanics that encourage the player to drink Grog regularly.
(somebody has an idea for this?)

5) Custom Mod Settings
Add settings to toggle sound effects for Guysword and Murray.

6) Autoscooter boat
Boat made of palmcone wood. Using already implemented rubber-bumpers. No target for Cookiecutters (possibly an oversight or crash risk?)

7) Stronger Gulet 
Gulet form can carry sculptures quickly like Mighty Wolfgang.

8) Balancing
Custom Items need to be balanced. Help appreciated.
