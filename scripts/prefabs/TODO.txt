Bugs:
- Adjust the amount of Grog for the Amgulet
- Secret invalid RPC 2 and 1 must be solved -> lags?
- swap_monkeycompass still needs to be compared with the original file so it is displayed when worn
- monkeycompass needs a visual overhaul
- when loading the server, the armor_pirate is not on the character. it is only displayed after re-equipping.
this seems to be due to ChangeToGuybrush/Gulet, which doesn't swap correctly on onload/spawn
- boat flooring from pinecone wood in the style of bumper cars (indestructible by cookiecutter somehow possible or crash?)
- Grog gets better when spoiled! (but only if the food values can be displayed correctly)
- driftwood chest (more slots like upgraded chest, but items get soaked)
- at line 54 the purple hud behind the grog needs to be moved down slightly
- Gulet form can carry sculptures quickly like Mighty Wolfgang
- modmain and grogballs have the food values
- fix dummylechuck bank/anim
- somehow more negative sanity boost
- guyhat should give more speed on water like the sleek hat. external mod is too complicated
- bone X on ground should give an item that I can then use for some other crafting
- guychest must be fed with guycoins. if >=2 guycoins in chest, then it smiles, otherwise a normal monkey.
- guychest coins - 1 coin per day (otherwise it spits out the items)
- the collision object of the guychest must be made smaller
- gulet gives tokens twice as fast
- build in some incentive for guybrush to drink
- beefalo should be fed grog and thus run faster for 5min
- beefalo becomes addicted to grog and can be tamed very quickly with it.
- but throws you off without grog every 5min
- Settings where you can turn off the sound effects of Guysword and Murray
